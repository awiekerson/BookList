<b> Booklist App </b>

Using a pre-existing website design, I developed a book list application using React, React Router, and Redux Toolkit for state management. Users can add, edit, delete books, and manage notes for each book, with dynamic
routing that allows navigation between different book pages based on their unique IDs. While the navigation using unique book IDs functions perfectly when the app is deployed through React, I am currently optimizing the navigation system for deployment on GitHub Pages.
